# Description

These Easybuild files are for deploying various easybuild files versus our machines/infra. In my need for creating an installation fast/easy some are copied/and or modified from different sources and migth not work on your machine. 


## issues

 - Some need fixing to conform easybuild standards.
 - Some need authorships/header descriptions edited.
 - The entire alphabet is complete missing the subfolders:jkquyz if you need something with these letters ill try to write something.
 - Travis should check the files.
